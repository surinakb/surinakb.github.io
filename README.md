# Solar Tracking Array – ELEC 327 Final Project

This repository contains the code, documentation, and supplemental materials for our ELEC 327 Final Project: a solar tracking array system designed to dynamically orient a solar panel toward the direction of highest light intensity.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to improve solar energy collection by designing a microcontroller-based system that uses light sensors and servo motors to actively track sunlight. The system rotates the panel in real-time to maximize exposure, with visual LED feedback for light intensity.
